## August 2 2022
This is the programming challenge for August 2nd 2022. This challenge comes from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/). I plan on implementing multiple versions of this challenge in a variety of languages so that I may become familiar with the how to utilize it in multiple languages. 

### Letter Value Sum

The challenge derives from the subreddit, r/dailyprogrammer. It is described as follows:
