# August 2022
----
In this month, I will be solving a variety of programming problems sourced primarily from r/dailyprogrammer. I plan on utilizing this repository to better enable myself to keep track of my progress as a programmer but to also help others along their journey as a programmer, developer, or hobbist.

## Goals
----
The goals for this month include,
    1) Learning OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles and strengthen the core foundation of utilizing objects, classes, and functions to build better programs and solutions.
    2) Designing solutions in both Python and Java. Utilizing both languages to strengthen my ability to produce solutions in a timely fashion.
    3) Become efficient in the amount of time needed to build a solution, implement a solution in another language and time spent on solving a given problem.
    4) Become more familiar with utilizing Data Structures such as Lists, Linked Lists, Hash Maps, and the like in order to familiarize myself with the applications of said Data Structures.
    5) Learn how to better utilize an API and implement a solution based upon the knowledge provided by them.

## Aspirations

----
My aspirations for this repository is for it to become a blog that showcases my solutions and other's solutions to problems given by r/dailyprogrammer. For this month, my goal is to begin development on said blog by implementing Jekyll for the site and it's content. My goal is to create at least one post on this blog each day, as I attempt to solve the problems provided to me.

I also want to get better at markdown and learn to collaborate with a community of people with the same goal as myself when it comes to the purpose of this repository.
