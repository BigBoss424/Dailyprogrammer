Well I can create this using Java, C and C++ so I'm thinking about creating
this application in all three languages to test my abilities and knowledge 
of the programming languages. 

Java 

I can simply create this in one class. This shouldn't require me
to create more than one class. This is simple should be a simple
program to write. I will be using VIM and the Linux Terminal as
my development environment. I believe that I can master the
Linux Terminal by writing my programs in the terminal itself. 
The only tricky part about this development process will be 
when the time comes to debug my code. I want to use other 
applications but if I am to be coding from a terminal on all
my other machines I might as well do it from the terminal anyways. 
 
C

C++
