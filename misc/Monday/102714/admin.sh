#First task on the list is:

#1) Get the 20 last used documents from the system and sort by the date they were modified.

#Second task on the list is: 

#2) Output the above command to a .txt file. 

#Third task on the list is:

#3) Retrieve the last 10 commands used on the console.

#Fourth task on the list is: 

#4) Get the 10 most CPU-heavy processes in descending order.

#Fifth task on the list is: 

#5) Retrieve the last 20 error logs/messages and output these as a formatted HTML table 

#Sixth task on the list is: 

#6) Retrieve all txt/pdf/exe files on the machine (You do not need to do the whole machine, just 1 drive is enough, or less if your machine is struggling).
